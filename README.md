# ChessVerse

ChessVerse is a browser-based chess game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, designed for both casual play and strategic challenge. It features two gameplay modes—two-player local play and a single-player AI mode powered by a custom Minimax algorithm. The game includes essential chess rules like check/checkmate detection, turn handling, and pawn promotion.

The UI is responsive and interactive, with a flip board feature that enhances the playing experience when switching turns. Additionally, the project includes a signup and login system using localStorage, allowing players to securely store and access their credentials without a backend.

Whether you're playing with a friend or challenging the AI, ChessVerse offers a smooth, accessible chess experience—all within your browser.
